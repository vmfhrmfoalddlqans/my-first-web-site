  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <P>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
    is an information system where documents and other
    web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
    by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The
    resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application
    called a web browser, and are published by a software application
    called a web server. The World Wide Web is built on top of the Internet,
    which pre-dated the Web by over two decades.
